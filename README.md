Contest tracking bot for Old School Runescape including Discord integration. 

Written as a series of scripts to run on a Raspberry Pi in order to track contests 
for the Old School Runescape group I play with. This will eventually be polished into
a more cohesive package, but we wanted it to be up and running first. Currently only 
fully supports skill XP competitions as the retreival of boss and activity highscores
is currently outdated with the package this project currently uses.
