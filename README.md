Contest tracking bot for Old School Runescape including Discord integration. 

Written as a series of scripts to run on a Raspberry Pi in order to track contests 
for the Old School Runescape group I play with. This will eventually be polished into
a more cohesive package, but we wanted it to be up and running first. As of v0.3.1,
the bot now supports both boss- and skill-based competitions and can now be set
up to run automatically with just a small number of cron jobs.

This project currently uses a fork of the osrs-highscores package which updates
it and resolves a few bugs that were preventing full functionality.
